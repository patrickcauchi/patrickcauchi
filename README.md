## Hi there 👋 I'm Patrick

🚧 I'm building **Day ZERO Protocol** — a personal operating system designed around four core actions: **Build**, **Learn**, **Connect**, and **Reflect**. It’s my first end-to-end system, helping me stay accountable while learning and creating.

💡 I'm exploring and building in:
- 🧠 AI agents & multi-agent systems  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity, cryptography & blockchain fundamentals  
- 📱 Full-stack development (web + mobile)  
- ⚙️ System design, autonomy, and high-agency tools

🎯 My long-term vision is to launch an **AI-native crypto quant fund**, powered by intelligent agent frameworks and programmable market models.

🛠️ Currently learning:  
→ Python, React, Solidity, system architecture, and secure dev practices

🧩 I believe in **high-agency living**, **clean systems**, and **foundational learning**.  
Let’s build something real — with clarity, precision, and purpose.
