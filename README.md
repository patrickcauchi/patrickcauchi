## Hi there 👋 I'm Patrick

🚧 I'm currently building **Day ZERO Protocol** – a personal operating system built around four core actions: **Build, Learn, Connect, Reflect**. It’s my first end-to-end app, helping me stay accountable while learning:

- 🧠 Multi-agent systems & AI integration  
- 🔐 Cybersecurity & blockchain fundamentals  
- 📱 Full-stack and mobile app development  
- ⚙️ Systems thinking and product design

🔭 Long-term, I’m building toward launching an **AI-native crypto quant fund**, combining agentic systems with market models.

📚 Currently learning:  
→ Python, React, system architecture, finance and secure development practices.

🧩 I believe in high-agency living, clean builds, and foundational learning.  
Let’s build something real.
